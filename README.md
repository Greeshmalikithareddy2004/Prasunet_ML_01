# Prasunet_ML_01
Introduction
This project uses a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses. The dataset includes features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living space, and lot size. The model is trained on this data and deployed via a Streamlit web app for user interaction.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
pip
Usage
Model Training
The model training is completed in the Jupyter notebook file House_Price_Prediction.ipynb. You can review and run the notebook for details on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Streamlit App
To start the Streamlit web application:

streamlit run app.py
This will open a local web server and allow you to interact with the model through a web interface.

Model Training
The House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook handles training the linear regression model. Here are the steps performed in the notebook:

Load the Dataset:

The notebook loads the dataset from dataset/data.csv.
Data Preprocessing:

Preprocesses the data, which includes:
Scaling features to ensure all input variables contribute equally to the model fitting process.
Model Training:

Trains a linear regression model using the preprocessed data.
Save Trained Model and Scaler:

The notebook saves the trained model (model.pkl) and scaler (scaler.pkl) using the pickle library. This allows for future predictions to be made without retraining the model.
Streamlit App
The app.py script sets up a Streamlit web application that:

Loads the trained model (model.pkl) and scaler (scaler.pkl).
Provides a user interface to input features.
Scales input features before making predictions.
Displays the predicted house price.
